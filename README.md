# PolaronMobility-FeynmanKadanoffOsakaHellwarth

These codes calculate the temperature-dependent polaron mobility for
a material. 
They solve the Feynman model, with Kadanoff's phonon-emission correction to the
FHIP mobility, Osaka's variational model for solving the Feynman model, and
Hellwarth's recent computationally convenient statement of the problem.

Underlying all this is the simplified Frohlich Hamiltonian [Frohlich1952] for
a single electron interacting with a phonon cloud of non-interacting (harmonic)
phonons.
The electron-phonon interaction is particularly simple, just considering
a dipole interaction. 
This is folded into a dimensionless `alpha` parameter, practically constructed
from dielectric constants of a material, and a characteristic frequency of the
dielectric response. 
(In a simple covalent semiconductor system, this is the frequency of the
linear-optical mode, the only infrared active one.) 
The Feynman model is a beautiful solution of this most simple quantum field
problem where the quantum field variable of the phonon field is integrated out
by the path-integral approach to quantum mechanics, to leave an electron
interacting via a spring constant with an effective mass---a single particle
problem. 

These Julia codes take Hellwarth's presentation of Osaka's variational
formulation of the Feynman solution,
optimise the `k` and `w` parameters for these finite-temperature free energies,
give a FHIP mobility, or a (corrected for phonon emission) Kadanoff mobility,
and provide alternative restatements of v and w as the mass of the phonon-drag,
and the spring constant.

They are applied to the case of hybrid halide perovskites, where in combination
they provide a model of (polaron) mobility without any free parameters. [No
arbitrary relaxation time is needed or used. The scattering processes are
treated directly, by including an effective electron-phonon coupling in the
specification of the Frohlich 'alpha' parameter, and then all other features
come from solving the model. ]

It was necessary to return to these (rather old!) papers and resolve the
models, as hybrid halide perovskites are soft materials with low energy
phonons. Therefore the effective temperature in terms of a reduced
thermodynamic beta (Beta=hbar omega / (k_Boltzmann * Temperature) ) is much
smaller than previously considered. 


## Bibliography

A bibliography in vague order of utility; read the first ones first!

Feynman also describes his Polaron solution in more detail in both 'Statistical
Mechanics' (Feynman1972) and 'Quantum Mechanics and Path Integrals'
(FeynmanHibbs1965). Note that the differing presentations of Feynman do not agree perfectly!

J.T. Devreese's "Fr√∂hlich Polarons. Lecture course including detailed
theoretical derivations" notes on the ArXiv is a very good place to start with general introductions.
