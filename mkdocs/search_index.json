We have parameters for various metal-halide Perovskite.\n\n\nIt is perhaps easiest to read and understand this documentation alongside the paper: \nFrost2017PRB\n (\nArXiv:1704.05404\n ).\n\n\nThe required inputs are the dielectric constants (\u03f5-static and \u03f5-optic) , a characteristic phonon frequency (\u03c9), and the bare-electron band effective-mass (me).  These values can be relatively easily calculated in the ab-initio electronic structure package of your choosing, or measured directly.\n\n\nFrom these four values, the code solves a temperature-dependent polaron model. This is done by variationally optimising the temperature-dependent free-energies for the coupled electron-phonon system. These optimised parameters describe the polaron with the infinite quantum field of lattice vibrations 'integrated through', and replaced with a phonon-drag term. From this the polaron features such as effective-mass, size of the wavefunction, frequency of energy oscillation etc. can be calculated.\n\n\nThis polaron state can then be used as an input to further models for polaron mobility.\n\n\nThe codes are designed to produce a set of temperature-dependent mobilities and other data, for direct incorporation into a scientific publication.\n\n\nMay your phonons drag in a manner truly sublime.\n\n\n\n\nScientific discussion\n\n\nThese codes solve Osaka's [Osaka1961] finite-temperature parameters for the Feynman polaron model [Feynman1959].  We copy the form used in [Hellwarth1999].\n\n\nFor each temperature, the total free energy of the Feynman coupled phonon-electron system is minimised by optimising coefficients which control the spring-coupling coefficient and effective-mass for the phonon cloud.  You have integrated through the infinite quantum field of the harmonic oscillators which make up the lattice, to collapse the problem abck to a quasi-particle. \n\n\nThe codes then calculate the polaron mobility, with both the original low-temperature FHIP approximation [Feynman1962], Kadanoff's [Kadanoff1964] Boltzmann equation motivated phonon-emission correction to the FHIP, and Hellwarth's [Hellwarth1999] method of returning to an earlier (non low-temperature) result in [Feynman1962], then directly calculating the contour integral for the polaron self-energy with numerical integration.\n\n\nUnderlying all this is the simplified Frohlich Hamiltonian [Frohlich1952] for a single electron interacting with a phonon cloud of non-interacting (harmonic) phonons. The electron-phonon interaction for a polar system is treated at the simple level of being the dielectric response.  These are the infrared-active modes present at the Gamma point in the Brillouin zone.  Along with an effective mode frequency, the dielectric constants are used to calculate the dimensionless '\u03b1' parameter describing the electron-phonon coupling.   (In a simple covalent semiconductor system, the only dielectric active mode is the linear-optical mode.)\n\n\nThe Feynman model offers a direct solution of this most simple quantum field problem.  The the infinite phonon (quantum) field is 'integrated out' by path integration.  The soluble system is one in which you have an electron interacting by a (harmonic) spring constant with a mass representing the phonon drag.  The variational method allows you to find a set of parameters for this simplified system which produces the smallest free-energy. \n\n\nThis is now a (renormalised) single particle system, a quasi-particle.\n\n\nThese Julia codes use Hellwarth's [Hellwarth1999] presentation of Osaka's variational free-energies for the Feynman model. We optimise the \nv\n and \nw\n parameters for these finite-temperature free energies. These can be alternatively restated the mass 'M' and spring-constant 'k' of the coupled phonon-electron Feynman model.\n\n\nHere we apply these methods to the case of hybrid halide perovskites. The method provides the temperature dependent polaron-mobility without any free parameters. No arbitrary relaxation time is needed or used. The scattering processes are treated directly, by including an effective electron-phonon coupling in the specification of the Frohlich 'alpha' parameter, and then all other features come from solving the model. The original Feynman model is correct to all orders in alpha, and the Hellwarth direct contour-integration of the general Feynman mobility statement is suitable for high temperature.\n\n\nIt was necessary to return to these (rather old!) papers and resolve the models, as hybrid halide perovskites are soft materials with low energy phonons. Therefore the effective temperature in terms of a reduced thermodynamic beta (Beta=hbar omega / (k_Boltzmann * Temperature) ) is much smaller than previously considered.\n\n\nA finaly note that in [Hellwarth1999], there is a mistake in the formula for 'b', which is also present in their prior PRL [Biaggio1997]. It is correct in [Feynman1962], where there is no factor of b on the right-hand side. It doesn't matter too much, as setting it to zero makes ~0.1% difference in the eventual mobility. However, since we're integrating numerically anyway, we may as well calculate it explicitly.\n\n\n\n\nResearch outputs\n\n\nPolaron mobilities, three different ways \n\n\nEffective mass of phonon cloud \n\n\nSpring constant for coupling to phonon cloud \n\n\nVariational (temperature-dependent free-energy) parameters for the coupled system \n\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n26th June 2017: The code works (and appears to be faster) with the new stable version of Julia (0.6). However, it still depends on the 0.7.x interface of \nOptim\n.

The codes then calculate the polaron mobility, with both the original low-temperature FHIP approximation [Feynman1962], Kadanoff's [Kadanoff1964] Boltzmann equation motivated phonon-emission correction to the FHIP, and Hellwarth's [Hellwarth1999] method of returning to an earlier (non low-temperature) result in [Feynman1962], then directly calculating the contour integral for the polaron self-energy with numerical integration.

This is a simple space-delimited text file, with each entry a separate temperature, for plotting with Gnuplot or similar.

Calculates a frequency dependent (over range of nu) susceptibility which can be linked back to mobility.  HERE BE DRAGONS!  Not well tested or validated code; the central numeric integration is highly oscillatory and becomes intractable for large nu.    source  #  PolaronMobility.polaronmobility     Method .  polaronmobility(Trange, \n                \u03b5_Inf, \u03b5_S, freq, effectivemass; \n                verbose::Bool=false)\n\nSolves the Feynman polaron problem variationally with finite temperature\nOsaka energies.  From the resulting v, and w parameters, calculates polaron\nstructure (wave function size, etc.).  Uses FHIP, Kadanoff (Boltzmann\nrelaxation time) and Hellwarth direct contour integration to predict\na temperature-dependent mobility for the material system. \nInput is a temperature range (e.g. 10:50:1000), \nreduced dielectric constants (e.g. 5, 20),\ncharacteristic dielectric phonon frequency (e.g. 2.25E12) - units Hertz\nbare-band effective-mass (e.g. 012) - units electron mass.\n\nReturns a structure of type Polaron, containing arrays of useful\ninformation.  Also prints a lot of information to the standard out - which\nmay be more useful if you're just inquiring as to a particular data point,\nrather than plotting a temperature-dependent parameter. \n\nAs an example, to calculate the electron polaron in MAPI at 300 K:\npolaronmobility(300, 4.5, 24.1, 2.25E12, 0.12)  source",
