We have parameters for various metal-halide Perovskite.\n\n\nIt is perhaps easiest to read this documentation alongside the pre-print: \nArXiv:1704.05404\n .\n\n\nThe scientific inputs are the dielectric constants, a characteristic phonon frequency, and the bare-electron band effective-mass.\n\n\nFrom this you can solve a temperature-dependent polaron model (variationally optimising temperature-dependent free-energies for the coupled electron-phonon system), and from this optimised parameters calculate derivative quantities such as the polaron mobility, and polaron features (effective masses, energy loss rates, oscillation etc.)\n\n\nMay your phonons drag in a manner truly sublime.\n\n\n\n\nScientific discussion\n\n\nThese codes solve Osaka's variational method for solving the Feynman model. For each temperature, the total free energy of the Feynman coupled phonon-electron system is minimised by optimising coefficients which control the spring-coupling coefficient and effective-mass for the phonon cloud.\n\n\nThe codes then calculate the polaron mobility, with both the original low-temperature FHIP approximation [Feynman1962], Kadanoff's [Kadanoff1964] Boltzmann equation motivated phonon-emission correction to the FHIP, and Hellwarth's [Hellwarth1999] method of returning to an earlier (non low-temperature) result in Feynman1962, then directly calculating the contour integral for the polaron self-energy with numerical integration.\n\n\nUnderlying all this is the simplified Frohlich Hamiltonian [Frohlich1952] for a single electron interacting with a phonon cloud of non-interacting (harmonic) phonons. The electron-phonon interaction is particularly simple, just considering a dipole interaction. This is folded into a dimensionless \nalpha\n parameter, practically constructed from dielectric constants of a material, and a characteristic frequency of the dielectric response. (In a simple covalent semiconductor system, this is the frequency of the linear-optical mode, the only infrared active one.) The Feynman model is a beautiful solution of this most simple quantum field problem where the quantum field variable of the phonon field is integrated out by the path-integral approach to quantum mechanics, to leave an electron interacting via a spring constant with an effective mass\u2013-a single particle problem.\n\n\nThese Julia codes use Hellwarth's [Hellwarth1999] presentation of Osaka's variational free-energies for the Feynman model. We optimise the \nv\n and \nw\n parameters for these finite-temperature free energies. These can be alternatively restated the mass 'M' and spring-constant 'k' of the coupled phonon-electron Feynman model.\n\n\nHere we apply these methods to the case of hybrid halide perovskites. The method provides the temperature dependent polaron-mobility without any free parameters. No arbitrary relaxation time is needed or used. The scattering processes are treated directly, by including an effective electron-phonon coupling in the specification of the Frohlich 'alpha' parameter, and then all other features come from solving the model. The original Feynman model is correct to all orders in alpha, and the Hellwarth direct contour-integration of the general Feynman mobility statement is suitable for high temperature.\n\n\nIt was necessary to return to these (rather old!) papers and resolve the models, as hybrid halide perovskites are soft materials with low energy phonons. Therefore the effective temperature in terms of a reduced thermodynamic beta (Beta=hbar omega / (k_Boltzmann * Temperature) ) is much smaller than previously considered.\n\n\nA finaly note that in [Hellwarth1999], there is a mistake in the formula for 'b', which is also present in their prior PRL [Biaggio1997]. It is correct in [Feynman1962], where there is no factor of b on the right-hand side. It doesn't matter too much, as setting it to zero makes ~0.1% difference in the eventual mobility. However, since we're integrating numerically anyway, we may as well calculate it explicitly.\n\n\n\n\nResearch outputs\n\n\nPolaron mobilities, three different ways \n\n\nEffective mass of phonon cloud \n\n\nSpring constant for coupling to phonon cloud \n\n\nVariational (temperature-dependent free-energy) parameters for the coupled system \n\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n26th June 2017: The code works (and appears to be faster) with the new stable version of Julia (0.6).
