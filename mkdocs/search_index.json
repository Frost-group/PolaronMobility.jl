We have parameters for various metal-halide Perovskites; as well as other systems.  These codes implement methods described across a wide range of now quite old literature.  The methods have been tested against literature values, and the calculated units more well understood.  They enable relative 'turn key' calculation of polaron parameters (most particularly the finite temperature charge carrier mobility) for an arbitrary material system, based on parameters that are standard to calculate with modern ab-initio electronic structure methods. \n\n\nThis documentation is intended to be read alongside the paper which was the first application (and motivation) for these codes:  \nFrost2017PRB\n (\nArXiv:1704.05404\n ).\n\n\nThe required inputs are the dielectric constants (\u03f5-static and \u03f5-optic) , a characteristic phonon frequency (\u03c9), and the bare-electron band effective-mass (me).  These values can be relatively easily calculated in the ab-initio electronic structure package of your choosing, or measured directly.\n\n\nFrom these four values, the code solves a temperature-dependent polaron model. This is done by variationally optimising the temperature-dependent free-energies for the coupled electron-phonon system. These optimised parameters describe the polaron with the infinite quantum field of lattice vibrations 'integrated through', and replaced with a phonon-drag term. From this the polaron features such as effective-mass, size of the wavefunction, frequency of energy oscillation etc. can be calculated.\n\n\nThis polaron state can then be used as an input to further models for polaron mobility.\n\n\nThe codes are designed to produce a set of temperature-dependent mobilities and other data, for direct incorporation into a scientific publication.\n\n\nMay your phonons drag in a manner truly sublime.\n\n\n\n\nInstallation\n\n\nThese codes require Julia >0.6 .

            "text": "Overview\n\n\nThese codes solve Osaka's [Osaka1961] finite-temperature parameters for the Feynman polaron model [Feynman1955].  We copy the form used in [Hellwarth1999].\n\n\nFor each temperature, the total free energy of the Feynman coupled phonon-electron system is minimised by optimising coefficients which control the spring-coupling coefficient and effective-mass for the phonon cloud.  You have integrated through the infinite quantum field of the harmonic oscillators which make up the lattice, to collapse the problem abck to a quasi-particle. \n\n\nThe codes then calculate the polaron mobility, with both the original low-temperature FHIP approximation [Feynman1962]; Kadanoff's [Kadanoff1964] Boltzmann equation motivated phonon-emission correction to the FHIP; and Hellwarth et al.'s [Hellwarth1999] method.  This last method (Hellwarth) is probably the most accurate.  It uses a more general (non low-temperature-approximation) result in [Feynman1962], then directly calculates the contour integral for the polaron self-energy with numerical integration.\n\n\nUnderlying all this is the simplified Frohlich Hamiltonian [Frohlich1952] for a single electron interacting with a phonon cloud of non-interacting (harmonic) phonons. The electron-phonon interaction for a polar system is treated at the simple level of being the dielectric response.  These are the infrared-active modes present at the Gamma point in the Brillouin zone.  Along with an effective mode frequency, the dielectric constants are used to calculate the dimensionless '\u03b1' parameter describing the electron-phonon coupling.   (In a simple covalent semiconductor system, the only dielectric active mode is the linear-optical mode.)\n\n\nThe Feynman model offers a direct solution of this most simple quantum field problem.  The the infinite phonon (quantum) field is 'integrated out' by path integration.  The soluble system is one in which you have an electron interacting by a (harmonic) spring constant with a mass representing the phonon drag.  The variational method allows you to find a set of parameters for this simplified system which produces the smallest free-energy. \n\n\nThis is now a (renormalised) single particle system, a quasi-particle.\n\n\nThese Julia codes use Hellwarth's [Hellwarth1999] presentation of Osaka's variational free-energies for the Feynman model. We optimise the \nv\n and \nw\n parameters for these finite-temperature free energies. These can be alternatively restated the mass 'M' and spring-constant 'k' of the coupled phonon-electron Feynman model.\n\n\nHere we apply these methods to the case of hybrid halide perovskites. The method provides the temperature dependent polaron-mobility without any free parameters. No arbitrary relaxation time is needed or used. The scattering processes are treated directly, by including an effective electron-phonon coupling in the specification of the Frohlich 'alpha' parameter, and then all other features come from solving the model. The original Feynman model is correct to all orders in alpha, and the Hellwarth direct contour-integration of the general Feynman mobility statement is suitable for high temperature.\n\n\nIt was necessary to return to these (rather old!) papers and resolve the models, as hybrid halide perovskites are soft materials with low energy phonons. Therefore the effective temperature in terms of a reduced thermodynamic beta (Beta=hbar omega / (k_Boltzmann * Temperature) ) is much smaller than previously considered.\n\n\nA finaly note that in [Hellwarth1999], there is a mistake in the formula for 'b', which is also present in their prior PRL [Biaggio1997]. It is correct in [Feynman1962], where there is no factor of b on the right-hand side. It doesn't matter too much, as setting it to zero makes ~0.1% difference in the eventual mobility. However, since we're integrating numerically anyway, we may as well calculate it explicitly.\n\n\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nThis bibliography is listed in vague order of utility; I recommend reading the first ones first!\n\n\nFeynman also describes his Polaron model in more detail in both 'Statistical Mechanics' [Feynman1972] and 'Quantum Mechanics and Path Integrals' [FeynmanHibbs1965]. Note that the differing presentations of Feynman do not always agree in detail.\n\n\nSchulman's 'Techniques and applications of path integration' has a 10-page chapter on the Polaron problem.
