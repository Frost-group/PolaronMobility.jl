The scattering processes are treated directly, by including an effective electron-phonon coupling in the specification of the Fröhlich α/'alpha' parameter, and then all other features come from solving the model. The original Feynman model is correct to all orders in alpha, and the Hellwarth direct contour-integration of the general Feynman mobility statement is suitable for high temperature.","category":"page"},{"location":"scientific_discussion/","page":"Scientific discussion","title":"Scientific discussion","text":"It was necessary to return to these (rather old!) papers and resolve the models, as hybrid halide perovskites are soft materials with low energy phonons. Therefore the effective temperature in terms of a reduced thermodynamic beta (beta=hbar omega / (kBoltzmann * Temperature) ; β=ħω/(kB.T) ) is much smaller than previously considered.","category":"page"},{"location":"scientific_discussion/","page":"Scientific discussion","title":"Scientific discussion","text":"A final note that: in [Hellwarth1999], there is a mistake in the formula for 'b', which is also present in their prior PRL [Biaggio1997]. It is correct in [Feynman1962], where there is no factor of b on the right-hand side. They probably didn't notice this, as they set it to zero.  This doesn't make too much difference (~0.1%, for the hybrid halide perovskites) to the calculated mobility.   Since we're integrating numerically anyway, we may as well calculate it explicitly.","category":"page"},{"location":"scientific_discussion/#Bibliography","page":"Scientific discussion","title":"Bibliography","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"scientific_discussion/","page":"Scientific discussion","title":"Scientific discussion","text":"This bibliography is listed in vague order of utility; I recommend reading the first ones first!","category":"page"},{"location":"scientific_discussion/","page":"Scientific discussion","title":"Scientific discussion","text":"Feynman also describes his Polaron model in more detail in both 'Statistical Mechanics' [Feynman1972] and 'Quantum Mechanics and Path Integrals' [FeynmanHibbs1965].
